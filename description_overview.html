						<h2>Project Description</h2>
						<p>Given the progress, work and sweat that went into the group’s project in Assessment 2, the team has decided to continue with the “Baby Boom Gate” project and refine the functionality and applicability of its use case. The group has become well acquainted with the features, pitfalls and intricacies of this product, but as the whole team developed a certain level of liking towards the aspired end-product, more time and effort was devoted to moving the project along.</p>
						<p> Given the fact that the Baby Boom Gate is going to be one-of-a-kind, and no comparable products are on the market, the team felt that it had produced a ground-breaking concept, worthwhile to be perfected, maybe even suitable to be brought to market. This perception is supported by the feedback our group project has received from our tutor for Assessment 2 that states that the group has “[…] a really well-established business case”.</p>
						<p> To drive this project even further to market it could be useful for the team to engage proper funding of the project, however, as this needs a more sophisticated approach, it can be beneficial to have support from engineering professionals that are more familiar with electronics of this type first. There are still many questions around the power supply and the form of mechanism, so that the product will perform optimally. Given the fact that the Baby Boom Gate currently exists only in a very rudimentary form, namely an Arduino with many cables, a product designer that can push the appeal of the product can prove beneficial as well. There is also a need to explore wireless options for the sensor to reduce cabling across the house, which requires more research and the trial of different products. Most likely there will also be the need for 3D printed parts to produce proper casings and components to optimise functionality even further. While the team has the skills and motivation to address the latter themselves, it requires additional capital investment that clearly exceeds students’ funds.</p>
						<p> Once the product is at launch level, there will be a need for a marketing campaign and a sales strategy, which again, will need input from professionals to be successful.</p>

						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h3>Topic</h3>
						<p>For A3 we will expand on Adam’s project idea that has been agreed to by the group for A2. The project has been developed throughout A2 to be a device that will automatically close a child-proof gate and turn on a night light when a motion sensor is triggered using an Arduino. We call the project ‘Baby Boom Gate’. The progress during the previous assignment has been to a stage where the team was able to define exactly what is necessary to make this project work and to identify the necessary technology.</p>
						<p> In this assignment the group has improved the software and technology for this project to move forward and worked on initial flaws. We have been able to produce a functional prototype that can close a baby gate upon being triggered by a laser “tripwire”. The team then addressed perfecting the motor to force ratio and the timing for the closing process to be applicable in a real-life situation. We also gained ground on necessary accessories regarding applicable levers for the motor and mounting mechanisms. The next step would be to produce an amicable casing for the Baby Boom Gate and to explore wireless technologies. </p>
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<p>By leaving the gate open, parents like Adam can make things convenient for themselves, however this in turn can prove dangerous for their young children. Adam describes that his child, and likely other people’s children too, has a habit to wander around at night and so they must keep the gate closed. When parents are still awake and the child is sleeping, this can be quite inconvenient, as the opening and closing of the baby gate produces noise that could wake the child up. That is the motivation for leaving the gate open in the first place. With this device, parents could leave the gate open without fear of harm. We have provided some market research to help supplement this motivation.</p>
