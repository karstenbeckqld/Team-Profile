						<h2>Risks</h2>
						<p>As with every product that utilizes electricity to function, loss of power poses a major risk. In the event of a total power failure, the baby boom gate, if connected to mains only, will stop working. Because there is no guarantee that a power outlet is available near every area where baby gates usually get mounted, a solution to overcome this potential issue is to have a battery backup system. </p>
						<p>Another risk is motor failure. As the Baby Boom Gate utilizes an electric motor, over time failure due to worn out brushes, dirt, or misuse can occur. This is an unavoidable threat to the product and will lead to the Baby Boom Gate failing to close. 
								If the Baby Boom Gate gets fitted incorrectly, it can lead to malfunction, device failure or even destroy the device. Therefore, correct fitting to the gate needs to be insured as per the instructions given. While this reads like a disadvantage of our product, it is valid for many electrical products in the market, and even a toaster needs to be placed in a special way to not burn a house down. So, the fitting mechanism of the Baby Boom Gate will be designed to be easy to understand and to enable installation without a professional. </p>
						<p>The sensor can of course show signs of malfunction. It is an integral part of the Baby Boom Gate and without a sensor, the whole product wouldn’t work. As with many products nowadays, the sensor will have to be replaced and cannot be repaired. Given the low prices of sensors, this is a common approach and likely appreciated by the customer, when compared with a costly repair bill.</p>
						<p>Toddlers move around fast, there’s hardly a moment when they just walk, most of the time they run because it is way more fun than walking like the boring adults. So, the Baby Boom Gate needs to close the gate fast. There lies a risk for the product. If the gate gets closed too slowly, the Baby Boom Gate has failed. As described in Plans &amp; Progress, the Baby Boom Gate only moves the gate past a pivot point to activate its self-closing mechanism. However, if this movement happens too slow, it poses a risk for a fast-moving toddler. Therefore, it needs to be ensured that the motor is strong enough and fast enough to fulfil its duty. Parents should also be referring to the installation instructions to guarantee optimal performance and ensure no obstacles can block the gate door from falling shut. </p>
						<p>A risk that is outside of the scope of the baby boom gate product is if the gate latch does not engage. If baby gates get mounted in a skewed way, the latch does not engage properly when the gate door falls shut. The best way to avoid this is to screw the wall cups of a pressure mounted gate to the wall and use the sticky pads, to reduce movement of the adjustment rods in relation to the gate itself. However, while this is a risk, it is a risk to the overall gate stability and functionality rather than the baby boom gate itself. Nevertheless, it needs to be considered as it can influence the functionality of our product.</p>
						<p>It almost goes without saying, that the baby boom gate should only be used with approved and tested baby gates. Using the product on a gate different to the above, can lead to malfunction and hence, render the product unfunctional. Users should check before installation if the Baby Boom Gate can be installed on their gates. 
								If the sensor that triggers the closing of the gate by our product is mounted at the wrong height, angle, position, it can lead to not being triggered correctly and hence for the baby gate not to close. Generally, this poses not too much of a problem, unless users mount the sensors in a completely different location as to what they are intended to be used for. Sensors usually have a reasonable range of detection and even with our new approach with a laser diode and LDR, which is somewhat limited in range of detection, a common sense approach will be sufficient to trigger the Baby Boom Gate. </p>

						<h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
						<p>IThe team for the Baby Boom Gate company has now been working together for around six weeks. Because communication for A2 was reliable and everyone delivered on their part, it was decided to meet once a week, at the usual timeslot, to discuss who needs to do what. The group chat via teams was always open and the team decided to utilise the @-function of MS Teams more often, to address members directly. Being located across the country, with lockdown situations emerging on a continuous basis, MS Teams seemed to be the best solution, also because file sharing, which is an integral part of this work, is a breeze with this tool. In special circumstances, like when the video team needed individual footage, additional meetings were setup. </p>
