      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      <p>Since the widespread adoption of cloud computing there have been enormous benefits to society. Perhaps the most obvious is the reduced cost of computing. When applications are run in the cloud, the bonus for computing resources is not on the end user, but on the company hosting the application. This results in lowering the required computing specifications for end users resulting in lower costs on computer hardware (CloudWATCH 2021).</p>
      <p>The introduction of Software as a Service has also greatly reduced the upfront costs of purchasing software licenses. Previously consumers would have to spend hundreds of dollars to buy a lifetime license for software, but thanks to SaaS consumers can use a pay-as-you-go subscription model that they can cancel at any time.</p>
      <p>Cloud computing has also introduced the idea of unlimited data storage. Previously users were constrained by the physical disks that they had on their computer, but with cloud computing users can store as much data as they want in the cloud without having to worry about buying the physical hardware. An added benefit of this is that users also do not have to worry about data reliability, as cloud providers have teams of people dedicated to ensuring that data is backed up in case of disaster.</p>
      <p>A benefit of being integrated into the cloud environment is that you no longer need to rely on a single device. If your device gets lost, stolen or damaged it is relatively easy to regain access to all your documents and software if they are provided to you by the cloud. This also means that there is no need to bring your device with you everywhere you go, so long as you have access to a computer with an internet connection, your workflow will not be interrupted.</p>
      <p>Another major benefit introduced by the Software as a Service model is the ability of universal document access and collaboration. Since applications and the data associated with them are stored in the cloud, users can easily collaborate with each other, sometimes in real time, and always have access to the most up to date documents.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one of the downsides to cloud computing is that users are sacrificing ownership for convenience. If the cloud service provider goes down, which is rare but does happen, you will also go down with them. There is also a lot of contention about the rules and regulations of data storage in different countries. For example, some users might be concerned that their data could easily be accessed by the US government if their data is stored anywhere within the USA.</p>

      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
      <p>In my personal life I am using cloud computing to quite a large extent. For example, I have a subscription to Spotify which hosts all my music in the cloud and allows me to access that music independently of my location. However, one potential downside to outsourcing my music library to Spotify has been that not all the content that I would have otherwise had in my CD library is available. There is also no guarantee that what is currently there will not be stripped away due to licensing issues.</p>
      <p>I am also using the following software as a service product; Adobe Creative cloud, Netflix, Google suite, Figma, Bitwarden password manager and Microsoft 365.</p>
      <p>At work I am managing around 25 businesses who are using a mixture of different deployment models for cloud computing. In the private cloud I have access to all servers and computers that have remote management agents installed on them. This means that all services can be provisioned and managed from anywhere. Transitioning from working in an office to working from home has been completely seamless because of this. It makes absolutely zero difference where I work from as long as I have a connection to the internet, I will be able to access and management resources.</p>
