						<h2>Roles</h2>
						<h3>Adam Ballantine – Head of R&amp;D</h3>
						<p>Adam is the initiator of the BBG project. He has done the majority of building, coding, and testing of the Baby Boom Gate device. His vision to find a solution to a problem millions of parents face is the driving force for the BBG project. He has the gate in question to be closed in possession. If the device was anywhere else, it could not be tested on the original gate for which the project was designed.</p>
						<h3>Alexander Goldberg – Chief Marketing Officer </h3>
						<p>Alexander has years of experience in a creative capacity and has been engaged in the creation of the presentation video, together with Ashley. He managed this project from storyboard to script to recording. He has also engaged in the design and market research for the product. Both Alexander and Ashley have extensive experience in this field.</p>
						<h3>Ashley Wilkie – Editor and Content Marketer </h3>
						<p>Ashley has worked with Alexander on the presentation video, focusing on creating content for the presentation and editing the sections of the video together. Both Alexander and Ashley have extensive experience in this field. </p>
						<h3>Jessica Warburton – Office Manager </h3>
						<p>Jessica has taken on the role of piecing together the sections of the Assignment and filling in gaps from the material created for A2. She has ensured that everybody is contributing to their required space and keeping the project on track for completion. Her organisational skills have been invaluable for this project.</p>
						<h3>Karsten Beck – Chief IT Officer </h3>
						<p>Karsten has taken the content created for the assignment and translated it into an amazing website for the BBG (Baby Boom Gate) company. Karsten has extensive experience in this role and did an incredible job with it for A2, so has continued in the same vein.</p>
						<h3>Paul Archie – Chief Financial Officer </h3>
						<p>Paul has researched individual components for the Baby Boom Gate device, including where to purchase and maintaining an overall budget for the project. His efforts have ensured that Adam was able to find what he needed to build the device without having to purchase endless supplies to keep experimenting. </p>

						<h2>Scope &amp; Limits</h2>
						<p>The purpose of this project is to create a working prototype using an Arduino to ensure that baby gates can be automatically closed for the safety of children. The project has been scoped for the length of the assignment. As we progress through the specific stages of the project certain deliverables will be produced. By the end of the assignment, we should have the following: </p>
						<ul>
								<li>Working prototype used for testing and refinement</li>
								<li>Report on market research to assess financial viability of project </li>
								<li>Company website and promotional video </li>
						</ul>
						<p>The biggest limitation to the project is the amount of time available. Because of this limitation we have decided to create the device as a standalone product that attaches to pre-existing gates, rather than creating our own gate with inbuilt functionality. This significantly reduces the material costs and ensures that we do not have to manufacture our gates to rigid safety standards. </p>
						<p>Another limitation to the project is the strength of the stepper motor. As a result of early-stage testing, we found that the stepper motor struggled to close the gate and rather than getting hung up on attempting to figure out how to increase the strength of the motor and introducing mains power, we have opted to investigate a simpler solution of a solenoid that should be able to work a 9V battery.  
								We also discovered issues with the PIR sensor and rather than attempting to fine tune the sensor, which is quite vulnerable to interface, we have opted instead to use a laser and LDR for detection. </p>
						<p>Obviously, there are a lot more things that we could do to eventually bring a project like this to the marketplace (as mapped out in our timeline), however due to the time limitations we have kept the scope small enough to be completed within the given period of the assignment. </p>
