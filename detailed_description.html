						<h2 class="line">Aims</h2>
						<p> The aim of the project is to use an Arduino and connected components to close a baby gate based on input from a sensor. The sensor is to be able to detect a child in proximity to activate the motor and the motor is to be able to push a child safety gate to a closed position. The aim can be split into two goals; firstly, to receive information from a sensor and secondly, to close the gate. The sensor needs to be sensitive enough that it will detect a toddler but directed enough that it won’t close anytime somebody goes near it. This will allow the parents to pass through the open gate without triggering the sensor. </p>
						<p>The device must then be able to close the gate once the sensor is triggered. As the gate is self-closing and auto-locking, it will simply need to be pushed hard enough to move it from its open position past a pivot point to let it close on its own. The gate will need to close quickly enough after the sensor is triggered to ensure that it cannot be reached while still open after the toddler is sensed.</p>

						<h2 class="line">Plans &amp; Progress</h2>
						<p>Below is a schematic of the Baby Boom Gate’s circuitry. A copy of the code is also included in the Appendix. </p>

						<p class="figure-caption">Fig. 3: Schematic of the Baby Boom Gate’s circuitry.</p>
						<p>The Baby Boom Gate is designed to solve a simple problem - an inconvenient baby gate at the top of a set of stairs. The gate needs to be there, and needs to be closed, for the safety of a child, but this is an inconvenience for the parents. If you carry something up the stairs, a closed gate is just in the way. So, our project was created to allow for the gate to remain open for the convenience of the parents, but to close automatically when the child comes within range in order to continue ensuring their safety. From the start it was apparent that a motion detecting device would be needed, along with something that could then physically close the gate, and something to communicate between the two.</p>
						<p>After Raspberry Pis and Arduinos were discussed at the beginning of the course in one of the podcasts, they were explored as options for processing the communication between the sensor and a motor. It didn’t take much research to see that while the Raspberry Pi units have a greater processing power, and are able to run far more complex programs, Arduinos are better suited to run simple programs and providing power to small devices. As the project at this point was only looking to take a single input and convert it to a single output, the Arduino was clearly the better fit. It was then a matter of looking into what motors work well with these devices and what kind of motion sensors are available. It was expected that this would start pushing up the budget of the device somewhat, but the reality is that the parts required are quite small and surprisingly cheap.</p>
						<p>A search of Arduino boards was conducted to find the available options and their specifications to determine what exactly was possible and what would be required to run the sensor and motor. Without a breadboard, potential power output of most Arduino boards was limited to 5V, and the most common motor used was a stepper motor. At this point it was not yet clear that this plan would bear fruit. The team had no prior experience with or understanding of breadboards. Therefore, we decided to begin without one, and to start to get an idea of what was possible with the littlest initial outlay possible. It also seemed that 5V would be sufficient for the needs of the project, so a 5V stepper motor was obtained. In terms of detecting motion, PIR motion sensors are common, readily available, and affordable, so a small PIR motion sensor was also obtained.</p>
						<p>Looking for Arduino boards in Australia was disappointing; delivery was the only option. The search to find one available immediately in person led to the discovery of Duinotech boards. Duinotech are essentially rebranded Arduino products sold through Jaycar as their own brand; so, a ‘replacement’ was found for the Arduino - a Duinotech UNO R3 development board (Jaycar 2021). The three components were purchased along with leads needed to connect them all. This is where the first issue arose. Both the PIR sensor and the motor were designed to be connected to a 5V output pin on the Duinotech board. As the Duinotech board only provided one of these pins, it was left aside for the moment until further advice could be obtained.</p>
						<p>The motor was connected according to the device’s documentation and the Arduino IDE was downloaded, ready to begin trying to program the board to operate the motor. Perfect: The IDEs library contained prewritten code for revolving a stepper motor first one way, then the other. The code was uploaded to the board and run - the motor barely moved. It took tiny little steps in a single direction, with a slow, stuttering motion. It had at least responded, so it was clear that the code was doing something, but not enough for anything useful. It seemed that the motor purchased was not the same as the one the code was designed for. Some searching on the internet found a blog with a more complex block of code that looked like it was designed for exactly the type of motor on hand (Rawashdeh 2018). Hence, we launched a new attempt with this code, and it was a great success. It turned the motor much quicker and more smoothly for a full revolution clockwise, followed by a similarly smooth revolution counterclockwise, and so on back and forth until the device was removed from power (at this point, via a USB plugged into a computer). Time now to try to connect the motion sensor.</p>
						<p>Again, it was a blog that had the answer. Being an open-source, community-driven development board, this is common for Arduino-based projects. An explanation was found that, while it is recommended to run the motion sensor of the 5V output pin, it is possible to power it from the 3.3V output pin - it simply needed to be connected to a different pin on the motion sensor (Santos 2015). This was done with success, and the documentation for the motion sensor provided code to test-run the device. An inbuilt LED on the Duinotech board was successfully turned on and off based on input from the motion sensor. All that remained for the code was to combine the two modules and adapt them so that the sensor would initiate the motor for a revolution and the motor would then stop. Ultimately, this proved more complicated than it seemed at first glance.</p>
						<p> It wasn’t hard to include the relatively simple code for the motion sensor with the more complex module for the stepper motor, and even to combine them so that the sensor set off the motor. But once the motor was triggered, it continued back and forth endlessly. It took some trial and error and studying the Arduino IDE documentation to eventually find the solution that worked. It was only at this point that the team realised that there was currently no way of powering the device without it being plugged into the computer. So a 9V battery snap connector and a toggle switch were purchased and attached. What was required now was to test if the 5V stepper motor produced enough power to push the gate closed. The gate itself is self-closing, once it is pushed past a certain point, so not a lot is required to close, but if the motor couldn’t manage, it would need replacing.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, the motor itself was simply turning a spindle, there wasn’t anything attached to it that could apply pressure to the gate. A makeshift paddle had to be created. Ultimately, a small Allen key connected to the spindle with a bulldog clip and a cable tie did the trick and the jury-rigged device was brought to the gate in question for testing. This was a mitigated success. The turning of the motor was just barely enough to push the gate far enough to trigger the self-closing. But it had to be held firmly to achieve this and it was clear that a bulldog clip and a cable tie were not going to be sufficient long-term solutions to everybody’s great surprise. It also needed to be approximately halfway along the gate from the hinge or further. It turned out that any closer to the hinge there was not enough torque. It was also apparent in situ that a PIR sensor was not the best choice for triggering the device, as it is hard to focus in a particular direction, meaning that it will be triggered by anybody passing nearby, not just a child nearing the gate. But proof of concept was achieved - a motion sensor successfully triggered a motor, which successfully closed the gate. It now simply needed tweaking and upgrading to improve the design enough to make it truly viable.</p>
						<p>The most obvious issue was securing the device. Something will be needed to hold the device firmly in place so that it can exert the force required without the assistance of a hand holding it steady. The ideal place for this is next to the hinge, but the stepper motor is not strong enough for that. So, the issue is the strength of the stepper motor, which is only just able to close the gate. There is also the concern that a single 9V battery will not last long enough to be practical when powering the device if it is to be left on overnight for safety. Lastly, upgrading from PIR to another sensor.</p>
						<p>Upgrading the sensor proved to be a simple fix. A laser diode was obtained along with light dependant resistor, or LDR. The LDR provides a signal by way of electrical resistance in the circuit based on how much light it detects. With the laser diode focused on the LDR, it detects a lot of light. If anything blocks the laser from hitting the LDR, the amount of light detected drops, allowing us to trigger the motor based on that signal. This effectively creates a laser ‘tripwire’ that can be placed outside the child’s room to specifically target someone passing through the doorway. The components were connected to the Duinotech board, the code slightly altered, and the device still worked. The motor turned when the laser tripwire was broken.</p>
						<div class="img-fluid"><img class="timeframe" src="images/tripwire.jpg" alt="a table showing the technology with an arduino and how the motor turns when the laster tripwire gets interrupted" /></div>
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 4: The Laser tripwire mechanism of the BBG baby boom gate.</p>
						<p>That describes the Baby Boom Gate in its current form, there are some plans in place for the future of the device to overcome the other challenges listed above. One is the inclusion of a clamping device to hold it in place. The idea is to attach it to the side of the gate at the base, near the hinge. This would be the best position for it to be stable in relation to the gate, while still having easy access to it to push it closed. It would also mean that nothing around the gate need be affected, i.e., it wouldn’t have to be attached to the floor or a wall, etc, keeping the device entirely confined to the gate for which it is an accessory.</p>
						<p>For the second issue, either a stronger or a different motor should be tested. A possible alternative is swapping out the stepper motor for a solenoid component to provide a more straightforward pushing action and removing the need for a paddle attachment. This would also remove one possible point of failure in that the connection between the motor and paddle is not especially strong in its current form. While a solenoid was obtained for testing, it could not be made to work with the device in the timeframe. More testing is required to determine the reason and find a solution. If an appropriate solenoid cannot be found or it proves through testing to not be an effective replacement, then a purpose designed, 3D-printed paddle will perhaps be necessary to continue with the stepper motor. If a stronger motor is needed, it will likely require a higher voltage power supply.</p>
						<p>Which raises the third issue to be addressed, which is the power supply. Stepper motors are not great choices for battery operations as they draw the same power when not in use as they do when in use, which is another point for substitution of a solenoid. The alternative is not changing the motor but changing from battery to mains supply. This will solve the battery life issue but will reduce portability. If batteries are to be kept, it might be necessary to switch to a 12V battery, which would support a considerably stronger motor, but will be somewhat more costly. In the meantime, a holder for 8 AA batteries was substituted for the 9V snap connector, providing 12V (8 x 1.5V) instead of 9V.</p>
						<p>With those few issues still to overcome, it is fair to say that the group has produced exactly what it set out to and achieved the aim of the project listed above. It will detect motion, specific to someone leaving the child’s room, then turn a motor that is capable of closing a safety gate.</p>

						<h2 class="line">Scope &amp; Limits</h2>
						<p>The purpose of this project is to create a working prototype using an Arduino to ensure that baby gates can be automatically closed for the safety of children. The project has been scoped for the length of the assignment. As we progress through the specific stages of the project certain deliverables will be produced. By the end of the assignment, we should have the following:</p>
						<ul>
								<li>Working prototype used for testing and refinement</li>
								<li>Report on market research to assess financial viability of project </li>
								<li>Company website and promotional video </li>
						</ul>
						<p>The biggest limitation to the project is the amount of time available. Because of this limitation we have decided to create the device as a standalone product that attaches to pre-existing gates, rather than creating our own gate with inbuilt functionality. This significantly reduces the material costs and ensures that we do not have to manufacture our gates to rigid safety standards.</p>
						<p> Another limitation to the project is the strength of the stepper motor. As a result of early-stage testing, we found that the stepper motor struggled to close the gate and rather than getting hung up on attempting to figure out how to increase the strength of the motor and introducing mains power, we have opted to investigate a simpler solution of a solenoid that should be able to work a 9V battery. We also discovered issues with the PIR sensor and rather than attempting to fine tune the sensor, which is quite vulnerable to interference, we have opted instead to use a laser and LDR for detection.</p>
						<p> Obviously, there are a lot more things that we could do to eventually bring a project like this to the marketplace (as mapped out in our timeline), however due to the time limitations we have kept the scope reasonable enough to be completed within the given period of the assignment.</p>

						<h2 class="line">Testing</h2>
						<p>Testing took place from the inception of this project. As Adam utilises a baby gate at home for his own child, it soon became our test lab for various configurations, motors, and sensors. Being able to test the Baby Boom Gate directly on a baby gate was invaluable. Because so many factors influence the functionality of this product (refer to Plans and Progress section for details), the group had to have a gate available to tweak the software, hardware, power supply and sensors. This ultimately let us improve the product within a very short timeframe to become more reliable, functional, and closer to being ready for the market.</p>

						<h2 class="line">Risks</h2>
						<p>As with every product that utilizes electricity to function, loss of power poses a major risk. In the event of a total power failure, the Baby Boom Gate, if connected to mains only, will stop working. Because there is no guarantee that a power outlet is available near every area where baby gates usually get mounted, a solution to overcome this potential issue is to have a battery backup system.</p>
						<p> Another risk is motor failure. As the Baby Boom Gate utilizes an electric motor, over time failure due to worn out brushes, dirt, or misuse can occur. This is an unavoidable threat to the product and will lead to the Baby Boom Gate failing to close. </p>
						<p>If the Baby Boom Gate gets fitted incorrectly, it can lead to malfunction, device failure or even destroy the device. Therefore, correct fitting to the gate needs to be insured as per the instructions given. While this reads like a disadvantage of our product, it is valid for many electrical products in the market, and even a toaster needs to be placed in a special way to not burn a house down. So, the fitting mechanism of the Baby Boom Gate will be designed to be easy to understand and to enable installation without a professional.</p>
						<p> The sensor can of course show signs of malfunction. It is an integral part of the Baby Boom Gate and without a sensor, the whole product wouldn’t work. As with many products nowadays, the sensor will have to be replaced and cannot be repaired. Given the low prices of sensors, this is a common approach and likely appreciated by the customer, when compared with a costly repair bill.</p>
						<p>Toddlers move around fast, there’s hardly a moment when they just walk, most of the time they run because it is way more fun than walking like the boring adults. So, the Baby Boom Gate needs to close the gate fast. There lies a risk for the product. If the gate gets closed too slowly, the Baby Boom Gate has failed. As described in Plans and Progress, the Baby Boom Gate only moves the gate past a pivot point to activate its self-closing mechanism. However, if this movement happens too slow, it poses a risk for a fast-moving toddler. Therefore, it needs to be ensured that the motor is strong enough and fast enough to fulfil its duty. Parents should also be referring to the installation instructions to guarantee optimal performance and ensure no obstacles can block the gate door from falling shut. </p>
						<p>A risk that is outside of the scope of the Baby Boom Gate product is if the gate latch does not engage. If baby gates get mounted in a skewed way, the latch does not engage properly when the gate door falls shut. The best way to avoid this is to screw the wall cups of a pressure mounted gate to the wall and use the sticky pads, to reduce movement of the adjustment rods in relation to the gate itself. However, while this is a risk, it is a risk to the overall gate stability and functionality rather than the Baby Boom Gate itself. Nevertheless, it needs to be considered as it can influence the functionality of our product.</p>
						<p> It almost goes without saying, that the Baby Boom Gate should only be used with approved and tested baby gates. Using the product on a gate different to the above, can lead to malfunction and hence, render the product unfunctional. Users should check before installation if the Baby Boom Gate can be installed on their gates. If the sensor that triggers the closing of the gate by our product is mounted at the wrong height, angle, or position, it can lead to not being triggered correctly and the baby gate not closing. Generally, this does not pose too much of a problem, unless users mount the sensors in a completely different location as to where they are intended to be used. Sensors usually have a reasonable range of detection and even with our new approach with a laser diode and LDR, which is somewhat limited in range of detection, a common sense approach will be sufficient to trigger the Baby Boom Gate.</p>

						<h2 class="line">Group Processes and Communication</h2>
						<p>The team for the Baby Boom Gate company has now been working together for around six weeks. Because communication for A2 was reliable and everyone delivered on their part, it was decided to meet once a week, at the usual timeslot, to discuss who needs to do what. The group chat via Teams was always open and the team decided to utilise the @-function of MS Teams more often, to address members directly. Being located across the country, with lockdown situations emerging on a continuous basis, MS Teams seemed to be the best solution, also because file sharing, which is an integral part of this work, is a breeze with this tool. In special circumstances, like when the video team needed individual footage, additional meetings were setup.</p>
