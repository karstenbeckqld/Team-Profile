      <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Adam</h3>
      <p>I am once again very happy with how well the group has worked together. I was pleasantly surprised by how well we all took on our own feedback from our processes for A2 and committed to the planned improvements. While communication was more streamlined in our meetings, which were a lot more efficient with our improved agendas, response times in the chat needed to be a bit quicker this time around. This was a bit disappointing, as I felt it was a strong suit in the last assessment. But it seemed as though we had possibly produced more material than we needed to for A2, leaving us in a strong position to start A3. This, combined with the division of the work into two assessments, made it quite easy to divide up the tasks. It also made it easier to have more distinct leadership roles, and I think the amount that this helped was the most surprising thing for me. Alex taking the lead on A5 was incredible and he and Ashley have together produced a presentation that we all feel really proud of. Meanwhile, Karsten has produced an absolutely amazing website that looks so much like the site for a reall BBG company that I want to work there. <br />
        While a desire for stronger leadership was something we all reflected on last time, the extent to which it made a difference was more profound than I’d expected.</p>
      <h3>Alex</h3>
      <p>Coming into A3 and A5 there was a much stronger idea about direction and working with the group. For myself, I knew I had the most experience in visual media production, the group all concurred and let myself spearhead A5 to which I believe had worked very well. In combination with Ashley to tackle A5, most of my interactions with the group were sharing our accounts of progress and the group provided ample amount of contribution through their own means as well as feedback and critiques for the work. When it came to A3 I was less involved but maintained communication. A3 had good leadership from Adam as he really took upon his mock role of ‘CEO’ of our faux company and all tasks were divided evenly. The group took well to the guidance and individuals such as Paul and Jessica had great energy and willingness to help and contribute. We could’ve improved on the levels of work though that could’ve been taken upon, but my personal take is that a lot of work from A2 was setup in A3 which may have caused no need for others to do as much. It is worth noting that the design aspect of ‘Baby Boom Gate’ couldn’t have been accomplished without Adam’s grit and resilience to keep pursuing the designs and researching better ways to improve it. As in A2 like A3, Karsten did a fantastic job forking my original GitHub repo and establishing a brand new web page with stunning company-like design, whilst also keeping the original A2 website he designed. Overall, both assessments are getting accomplished and not without fault but as a group our biggest strength is how our differing skills and personalities seem to work well with one another. </p>
      <h3>Ashley</h3>
      <p>I have not been as involved as I would like in the group. The group is very welcoming and understanding even when I have not been up to any reasonable standards. We had a couple of Group video meetings, which I could not attend but watched later as they were recorded. I found the Interview with Martyn from Gameloft fascinating and helpful insight into the gaming industry. It never appeared to me how many teams or people were involved in making a game. The group worked well, and they communicated well with each other.</p>
      <h3>Jessica</h3>
      <p>Throughout the assignment we have worked considerably well. We have managed to run much more effective meetings that start and finish on time. During these meetings we have quickly been able to ascertain what needs to get done to move forward. Once again, the group has managed to communication very effectively and allocate and assign work quickly. We have been fortunate to be a diverse group in our skillsets and this enabled us to hand specific tasks to individuals who possessed strengths in those areas. I feel as though any time there was uncertainty regarding issues in the assignment, a weekly meeting was able to quickly clarify any of those issues and we managed to reach a consensus. Overall, it was a delight working with this group and the weekly meetings have been both highly informative and entertaining.</p>
      <h3>Karsten</h3>
      <p>After a not unexpected work-intensive end of assessment 2 (A2), the team had a slow start on this assessment 3. While many, including myself, appeared unprepared for the Kick-off meeting, this changed quickly for the following meetings. Right from the start, we divided the tasks for A3 and assessment 5 (A5) amongst team members so that everybody could focus on the tasks ahead.<br />
        The dominance of some members showed even more in this assessment and Adam and Alex took on lead roles for their respective parts, namely A3 and A5, respectively. This was a welcomed development as it provided guidance and motivation. <br />
        We continued using MS Teams as our primary source of communication, only that this time the communication became more focused and stringent. Again, the weekly video conferences proved productive and delivered clarifications as necessary.<br />
        There was a lack of participation of one team member, which then had to be addressed by others, adding to their workload. This, unfortunately, added unnecessary stress to other team members. <br />
        However, overall, the team still worked coherently. As in A2, the group progressed on both assignments to produce a desirable outcome for A3 and A5. It needs mentioning that the team that looked after A5 did a fantastic job on the video presentation and put a lot of effort and sweat into the final product. But also, the work of the A3 team showed a solid outcome. </p>
      <h3>Paul</h3>
      <p>Heading into A3 and A5 after being involved with the group doing A2, I was very pleased with the way we all worked together. Tasks were allocated to the people who most suited the particular areas of the assignments that needed to be done. <br />
        The group worked well with lots of discussions during team meetings. I feel we should all do very well with the assignments. The hierarchal structure of the group compared to A2 was very evident this time around and I feel it helped the group as a whole be more productive.  </p>

      <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
      <p>As with A2, the sentiment is similar across almost all members of the group: having stronger leadership worked extremely well, the more structured meetings ran more efficiently, and we’ve continued to work well together as a group. Having all had the same idea last time, it was no hard sell for us to take on our own feedback and challenge to ourselves to improve. We have all left feeling very lucky to have been in Group 10; each member was welcoming and welcomed, generous and considerate. We had a broad spread of backgrounds, talents, and experience, and we were able to each contribute in our own way. If we were to look to improve again, we would focus on the weekly chats between meetings to ensure they were followed up more quickly. It was not convenient for us as a group to have more than one meeting a week, meaning that we relied heavily on the chat to maintain communication. If a message was missed or not replied to, it made it hard to know whether it had been received or not. </p>
      <p>Once again, the group feels that we have produced a great project. Coming off a strong base from our A2 and making improvements to our process based on our own feedback. While again the content creation does not look evenly spread across the group, the way we balanced extra backend or organisational efforts worked so well for us in A2 that we continued in the same vein. This time, with two assessments, Alex took control of A5 and worked closely with Ashley to produce the video, while Adam took the lead on A3. Karsten again focused on the website, while still contributing to the content for both A3 and A5 and Jessica and Paul also produced content for both assessments. This strategy helped to focus our efforts and ensure we all had specific goals to work towards. </p>
